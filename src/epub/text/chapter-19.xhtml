  <p epub:type="bridgehead">
    Of the Lord Spitfire’s besieging of the witches in his own castle of
    Owlswick; and how he did battle against Corinius under Thremnir’s
    Heugh, and the men of Witchland won the day.
  </p></header>

  <p>Lord Spitfire sat in his pavilion before Owlswick in mickle discontent.
    A brazier of hot coals made a pleasant warmth within, and lights filled
    the rich tent with splendour. From without came the noise of rain
    steadily falling in the dark autumn night, splashing in the puddles,
    pattering on the silken roof. Zigg sat by Spitfire on the bed, his
    hawk-like countenance shadowed with an unwonted look of care. His sword
    stood between his knees point downward on the floor. He tipped it
    gently with either hand now to the left now to the right, watching with
    pensive gaze the warm light shift and gleam in the ball of balas ruby
    that made the pommel of the sword.</p>

  <p>“Fell it out so accursedly?” said Spitfire. “All ten, thou saidst, on
    Rammerick Strands?”</p>

  <p>Zigg nodded assent.</p>

  <p>“Where was he that he saved them not?” said Spitfire. “O, it was vilely
    miscarried!”</p>

  <p>Zigg answered, “’Twas a swift and secret landing in the dark a mile
    east of the harbour. Thou must not blame him unheard.”</p>

  <p>“What more remain to us?” said Spitfire. “Content: I’ll hear him.
    What ships remain to us, is more to the purpose. Three by Northsands
    Eres, below Elmerstead: five on Throwater: two by Lychness: two more
    at Aurwath: six by my direction on Stropardon Firth: seven here on the
    beach.”</p>



  <p>“Besides four at the firth head in Westmark,” said Zigg. “And order is
    ta’en for more in the Isles.”</p>

  <p>“Twenty and nine,” said Spitfire, “and those in the Isles beside. And
    not one afloat, nor can be ere spring. If Laxus smell them out and take
    them as lightly as these he burned under Volle’s nose on Rammerick
    Strands, we do but plough the desert building them.”</p>

  <p>He rose to pace the tent. “Thou must raise me new forces for to break
    into Owlswick. ’Fore heaven!” he said, “this vexes me to the guts, to
    sit at mine own gate full two months like a beggar, whiles Corsus and
    those two cubs his sons drink themselves drunk within, and play at
    cock-shies with my treasures.”</p>

  <p>“O’ the wrong side of the wall,” said Zigg, “the master-builder may
    judge the excellence of his own building.”</p>

  <p>Spitfire stood by the brazier, spreading his strong hands above the
    glow. After a time he spake more soberly. “It is not these few ships
    burnt in the north should trouble me; and indeed Laxus hath not five
    hundred men to man his whole fleet withal. But he holdeth the sea,
    and ever since his putting out into the deep with thirty sail from
    Lookinghaven I do expect fresh succours out of Witchland. ’Tis that
    maketh me champ still on the bit till this hold be won again; for then
    were we free at least to meet their landing. But ’twere most unfit at
    this time of the year to carry on a siege in low and watery grounds,
    the enemy’s army being on foot and unengaged. Wherefore, this is my
    mind, O my friend, that thou go with haste over the Stile and fetch me
    supply of men. Leave force to ward our ships a-building, wheresoever
    they be; and a good force in Krothering and thereabout, for I will not
    be found a false steward of his lady sister’s safety. And in thine
    own house make sure. But these things being provided, shear up the
    war-arrow and bring me out of the west fifteen or eighteen hundred
    men-at-arms. For I do think that by me and thee and such a head of men
    of Demonland as we shall then command Owlswick gates may be brast open
    and Corsus plucked out of Owlswick like a whilk out of his shell.”</p>

  <p>Zigg answered him, “I’ll be gone at point of day.”</p>

  <p>Now they rose up and took their weapons and muffled themselves in their
    great campaigning cloaks and went forth  with torch-bearers to walk
    through the lines, as every night ere he went to rest it was Spitfire’s
    wont to do, visiting his captains and setting the guard. The rain fell
    gentlier. The night was without a star. The wet sands gleamed with the
    lights of Owlswick Castle, and from the castle came by fits the sound
    of feasting heard above the wash and moan of the sullen sleepless sea.</p>

  <p>When they had made all sure and were come nigh again to Spitfire’s tent
    and Zigg was upon saying good-night, there rose up out of the shadow
    of the tent an ancient man and came betwixt them into the glare of the
    torches. Shrivelled and wrinkled and bowed he seemed as with extreme
    age. His hair and his beard hung down in elf-locks adrip with rain.
    His mouth was toothless, his eyes like a dead fish’s eyes. He touched
    Spitfire’s cloak with his skinny hand, saying in a voice like the
    night-raven’s, “Spitfire, beware of Thremnir’s Heugh.”</p>

  <p>Spitfire said, “What have we here? And which way the devil came he into
    my camp?”</p>

  <p>But that aged man still held him by the cloak, saying, “Spitfire, is
    not this thine house of Owlswick? And is it not the most strong and
    fair place that ever man saw in this countree?”</p>

  <p>“Filth, unhand me,” said Spitfire, “else shall I presently thrust thee
    through with my sword, and send thee to the Tartarus of hell, where I
    doubt not the devils there too long await thee.”</p>

  <p>But that aged man said again, “Hot stirring heads are too easily
    entrapped. Hold fast, Spitfire, to that which is thine, and beware of
    Thremnir’s Heugh.”</p>

  <p>Now was Lord Spitfire wood angry, and because the old carle still held
    him by the cloak and would not let him go, plucked forth his sword,
    thinking to have stricken him about the head with the flat of his
    sword. But with that stroke went a gust of wind about them, so that
    the torch-flames were nigh blown out. And that was strange, of a still
    windless night. And in that gust was the old man vanished away like a
    cloud passing in the night.</p>

  <p>Zigg spake: “The thin habit of spirits is beyond the force of weapons.”</p>

  <p>“Pish!” said Spitfire. “Was this a spirit? I hold it  rather a
    simulacrum or illusion prepared for us by Witchland’s cunning, to
    darken our counsel and shake our resolution.”</p>

  <hr/>

  <p>On the morrow while yet sunrise was red, Lord Zigg went down to the
    sea-shore to bathe in the great rock pools that face southward across
    the little bay of Owlswick. The salt air was fresh after the rain. The
    wind that had veered to the east blew in cold and pinching gusts. In a
    rift between slate-blue clouds the low sun flamed blood-red. Far to the
    south-east where the waters of Micklefirth open on the main, the low
    cliffs of Lookinghaven-ness loomed shadowy as a bank of cloud.</p>

  <p>Zigg laid down his sword and spear and looked south-east across the
    firth; and behold, a ship in full sail rounding the ness and steering
    northward on the larboard tack. And when he had put off his kirtle he
    looked again, and behold, two more ships a-steering round the ness and
    sailing hard in the wake of the first. So he donned his kirtle again
    and took his weapons, and by then were fifteen sail a-steering up the
    firth in line ahead, dragons of war.</p>

  <p>So he fared hastily to Spitfire’s tent, and found him yet abed,
    for sweet sleep yet nursed in her bosom impetuous Spitfire; his
    head was thrown back on the broidered pillow, displaying his strong
    shaven throat and chin; his fierce mouth beneath his bristling fair
    moustachios was relaxed in slumber, and his fierce eyes closed in
    slumber beneath their yellow bristling eyebrows.</p>

  <p>Zigg took him by the foot and waked him and told him all the matter:
    “Fifteen ships, and every ship (as I might plainly see as they drew
    nigh) as full of men as there be eggs in a herring’s roe. So cometh our
    expectation to the birth.”</p>

  <p>“And so,” said Spitfire, leaping from the couch, “cometh Laxus again to
    Demonland, with fresh meat to glut our swords withal.”</p>

  <p>He caught up his weapons and ran to a little knoll that stood above
    the beach over against Owlswick Castle. And all the host ran to behold
    those dragons of war sail up the firth at dawn of day.</p>

  <p>“They dowse sail,” said Spitfire, “and put in for Scaramsey. ’Tis not
    for nothing I taught these Witchlanders on the Rapes of Brima. Laxus,
    since he witnessed that downthrow of their army, now accounteth islands
    more wholesomer  than the mainland, well knowing we have nor sails nor
    wings to strike across the firth at him. Yet scarcely by skulking in
    the islands shall he break up the siege of Owlswick.”</p>

  <p>Zigg said, “I would know where be his fifteen other ships.”</p>

  <p>“In fifteen ships,” said Spitfire, “it is not possible he beareth more
    than sixteen hundred or seventeen hundred men of war. Against so many I
    am strong enough to-day, should they adventure a landing, to throw ’em
    into the sea and still contain Corsus if he make a sally. If more be
    added, I am the less secure. Therefore occasion calleth but the louder
    for thy purposed faring to the west.”</p>

  <p>So the Lord Zigg called him out a dozen men-at-arms and went
    a-horseback. By then were all the ships rowed ashore under the southern
    spit of Scaramsey, where is good anchorage for ships. They were there
    hidden from view, all save their masts that showed over the spit, so
    that the Demons might observe nought of their disembarking.</p>

  <p>Spitfire rode with Zigg three miles or four, as far as the brow of
    the descent to the fords of Ethreywater, and there bade him farewell.
    “Lightning shall be slow to my hasting,” said Zigg, “till I be back
    again. Meantime, I would have thee be not too scornfully unmindful of
    that old man.”</p>

  <p>“Chirking of sparrows!” said Spitfire. “I have forgot his brabble.”
    Nevertheless his glance shifted southward beyond Owlswick to the great
    bluff of tree-hung precipice that stands like a sentinel above the
    meadows of Lower Tivarandardale, leaving but a narrow way betwixt its
    lowest crags and the sea. He laughed: “O my friend, I am yet a boy in
    thine eyes it seemeth, albeit I am well-nigh twenty-nine years old.”</p>

  <p>“Laugh at me and thou wilt,” said Zigg. “Without this word said I could
    not leave thee.”</p>

  <p>“Well,” said Spitfire, “to lull thy fears, I’ll not go a-birdsnesting
    on Thremnir’s Heugh till thou come back again.”</p>

  <hr/>

  <p>Now for a week or more was nought to tell of save that Spitfire’s army
    sat before Owlswick, and they on the island sent ever and again three
    or four ships to land suddenly about Lookinghaven or at the head of
    the firth, or southaway beyond Drepaby, as far as the coastlands under
    Rimon Armon, harrying and burning. And as oft as force was gathered
    against them, they fared aboard again and sailed back to Scaramsey. In
    those days came Volle from the west with an hundred men and joined him
    with Spitfire.</p>

  <p>The eighth day of November the weather worsened, and clouds gathered
    from the west and south, till all the sky was a welter of huge watery
    leaden clouds, separated one from another by oily streaks of white. The
    wind grew fitful as the day wore. The sea was dark like dull iron. Rain
    began to fall in big drops. The mountains showed monstrous and shadowy:
    some dark inky blue, others in the west like walls and bastions of
    clotted mist against the hueless mist of heaven behind them. Evening
    closed with thunder and rain and lightning-torn banks of vapour. All
    night long the thunder roared in sullen intermission, and all night
    long new banks of thunder-cloud swung together and parted and swung
    together again. And the light of the moon was abated, and no light seen
    save the levin-brand, and the camp-fires before Owlswick, and the light
    of revelry within. So that the Demons camped before the castle were not
    ware of those fifteen ships that put out from Scaramsey on that wild
    sea and landed two or three miles to the southward by the great bluff
    of Thremnir’s Heugh. Nor were they ware at all of them that landed
    from the ships: fifteen or sixteen hundred men-at-arms with Heming of
    Witchland and his young brother Cargo for their leaders. And the ships
    rowed back to Scaramsey through the loud storm and fury of the weather,
    all save one that foundered in Bothrey Sound.</p>

  <p>But on the morn, when the tempest was abated, might all behold the
    putting forth of fourteen ships of war from Scaramsey, every ship of
    them laden with men-at-arms. They had passage swiftly over the firth,
    and came aland two miles south of Owlswick. And the ships stood off
    again from the land, but the army marshalled for battle on the meads
    above Mingarn Hope.</p>

  <p>Now Lord Spitfire let draw up his men and moved out southward from the
    lines before Owlswick. When they were come within some half mile’s
    distance of the Witchland army, so that they might see clearly their
    russet kirtles and their shields and body-armour of bronze, and the
    dull glint of their sword-blades and the heads of their spears, Volle,
    that rode by Spitfire, spake and said, “Markest thou him, O Spitfire,
    that rideth back and forth before their battle, marshalling them? So
    ever rode Corinius; and well mayst thou know him even  afar off by his
    showiness and jaunting carriage. Yet see a great wonder now: for who
    ever heard tell of this young hotspur giving back from the fight? And
    now, or ever we be gotten within spear-shot——”</p>

  <p>“By the bright eye of day,” cried Spitfire, “’tis so! Will he baulk me
    quite of a battle? I’ll loose a handful of horse upon them to delay
    their haste ere they be flown beyond sight and finding.”</p>

  <p>Therewith he gave command to his horsemen to ride forth upon the enemy.
    And they rode forth with Astar of Rettray, that was brother-in-law
    to Lord Zigg, for their leader. But the Witchland horse met them by
    the shallows of Aron Pow and held them in the shallows while Corinius
    with his main army won across the river. And when the main body of
    the Demons were come up and the passage forced, the Witchlanders were
    gotten clean away across the water-meadows to the pass betwixt the
    shore and the steeps of Thremnir’s Heugh.</p>

  <p>Then said Spitfire, “They stay not to form even i’ the narrow way
    ’twixt the sea and the Heugh. And that were their safety, if they had
    but the heart to turn and stand us.” And he shouted with a great shout
    upon his men to charge the enemy, and suffer not a Witch to overlive
    that slaughter.</p>

  <p>So the footmen caught hold of the stirrup-leathers of the horsemen,
    and running and riding they poured into the narrow pass; and ever was
    Spitfire foremost among his men, hewing to left and to right among the
    press, riding on that whelming battle-tide that seemed to bear him on
    to triumph.</p>

  <p>But now on a sudden was he, who with but twelve hundred men had so
    hotly followed fifteen hundred into the strait passage under Thremnir’s
    Heugh, made ware too late that he must have to do with three thousand:
    Corinius rallying his folk and turning like a wolf in the pass, while
    Corund’s sons, that had landed as aforesaid in the storm in the mirk
    of night, swept down with their battalions from the wooded slopes
    behind the Heugh. In such wise that Spitfire wist not sooner of any
    foreshadowing of disaster than of disaster’s self: the thunder of the
    blow in flank and front and rear.</p>

  <p>Then befell great manslaying between the sea-cliffs and the sea. The
    Demons, taken at that advantage, were like a man tripped in mid-stride
    by a rope across the way. By the sore onset of the Witches they were
    driven down into the  shallows of the sea, and the spume of the sea
    was red with blood. And the Lord Corinius, now that he had done with
    feigned retreat, fared through the battle like a stream of unquenchable
    wildfire, that none might sustain his strokes that were about him.</p>

  <p>Now was Spitfire’s horse slain under him with a spear-thrust, as riding
    fetlock-deep in the yielding sand he rallied his men to fling back
    Heming. But Bremery of Shaws brought him another horse, and so mightily
    went he forth against the Witches that the sons of Corund were fain to
    give back before his onslaught, and that wing of the Witchland army was
    pressed back against the broken ground below the Heugh. Yet was that
    of little avail, for Corinius brake through from the north, thrusting
    the Demons with great slaughter back from the sea, so that they were
    penned betwixt him and Heming. Therewith Spitfire turned with some
    picked companies against Corinius; and well it seemed for awhile that
    a great force of the Witches must be whelmed or drowned in the salt
    waves. And Corinius himself stood now in great peril of his life, for
    his horse was bogued in the soft sands and might not win free for all
    his plunging.</p>

  <p>In that nick of time came Spitfire through the stour, with a band of
    Demons about him, slaying as he came. He shouted with a terrible voice,
    “O Corinius, hateful to me and mine as are the gates of Hell, now will
    I kill thee, and thy dead carcase shall fatten the sweet meads of
    Owlswick.”</p>

  <p>Corinius answered him, “Bloody Spitfire, last of three whelps, for thy
    brothers are by now dead and rotten, I shall give thee a choke-pear.”</p>

  <p>Therewith Spitfire shot a twirl-spear at him. It missed the man but
    smote the great horse in the shoulder so that he plunged and fell in
    a heap, hurt to the death. But the Lord Corinius lighting nimbly on
    his feet caught Spitfire’s horse by the bridle rein and smote it on
    the muzzle, even as he rode at him, so that the horse reared up and
    swerved. Spitfire made a great blow at him with an axe, but it came
    slantwise on the helmet ridge and glented aside in air. Then Corinius
    thrust up under Spitfire’s shield with his sword, and the point entered
    the big muscle of the arm near the armpit, and glancing against the
    bone tore up through the muscles of the shoulder. And that was a great
    wound.</p>



  <p>Nevertheless Spitfire slacked not from the fight, but smote at him
    again, thinking to have hewn off his arm the hand whereof still
    clutched the bridle-rein. Corinius caught the axe on his shield, but
    his fingers loosed the rein, and almost he fell to earth under that
    mighty stroke, and the good bronze shield was dented and battered in.</p>

  <p>Now with the loosing of the reins was Spitfire’s horse plunged forward,
    carrying him past Corinius toward the sea. But he turned and hailed
    him, crying, “Get thee an horse. For I count it unworthy to fight with
    thee bearing this advantage over thee, I a-horseback and thou on foot.”</p>

  <p>Corinius cried out and answered, “Come down from thine horse then, and
    meet me foot to foot. And know it, my pretty throstle-cock, that I am
    king in Demonland, which dignity I hold of the King of Kings, Gorice of
    Witchland, mine only overlord. Meet it is that I show thee in combat
    singular, that vauntest thyself greatest among the rebels yet left
    alive in this my kingdom, how much greater is my might than thine.”</p>

  <p>“These be great and thumping words,” said Spitfire. “I shall thrust
    them down thy throat again.”</p>

  <p>Therewith he made as if to light down from his horse; but as he strove
    to light down, a mist went before his eyes and he reeled in his saddle.
    His men rushed in betwixt him and Corinius, and the captain of his
    bodyguard bare him up, saying, “You are hurt, my lord. You must not
    fight no more with Corinius, for your highness is unmeet for fighting
    and may not stand alone.”</p>

  <p>So they that were about him bare up great Spitfire. And the mellay that
    was stayed while those lords dealt together in single combat brake
    forth afresh in that place. But all the while had furious war swung
    and ravened below Thremnir’s Heugh, and wondrous was the valour of the
    Demons; for many hundred were slain or wounded to the death, and but a
    small force were they that yet remained to bear up the battle against
    the Witches.</p>

  <hr/>

  <p>Now those that were with Spitfire departed with him in the secretest
    manner that they could out of the fight, wrapping about him a
    watchet-coloured cloak to hide his shining armour. They stanched the
    blood that ran from the great wound in his shoulder and bound it
    up carefully, and carried  him a-horseback by Volle’s command into
    Tremmerdale by secret mountain paths up to a desolate corrie east of
    Sterry Gap, under the great scree-shoot that flanks the precipices of
    the south summit of Dina. A long time he lay there senseless, like
    to one dead. For many hurts had he taken in the unequal fight, and
    greatly was he bruised and battered, but worst of all was the sore hurt
    Corinius gave him ere they parted betwixt the limits of land and sea.</p>

  <p>And when night was fallen and all the ways were darkened, came the Lord
    Volle with a few companions utterly wearied to that lonely corrie. The
    night was still and cloudless, and the maiden moon walked high heaven,
    blackening the shadows of the great peaks that were like sharks’ teeth
    against the night. Spitfire lay on a bed of ling and cloaks in the lee
    of a great boulder. Ghastly pale was his face in the silver moonlight.</p>

  <p>Volle leaned upon his spear looking earnestly upon him. They asked him
    tidings. And Volle answered, “All lost,” and still looked upon Spitfire.</p>

  <p>They said, “My lord, we have stanched the blood and bound up the wound,
    but his lordship abideth yet senseless. And greatly we fear for his
    life, lest this great hurt yet prove his bane-sore.”</p>

  <p>Volle kneeled beside him on the cold sharp stones and tended him as
    a mother might her sick child, applying to the wound leaves of black
    horehound and millefoil and other healing simples, and giving him to
    drink out of a flask of precious wine of Arshalmar, ripened for an
    age in the deep cellars below Krothering. So that in a while Spitfire
    opened his eyes and said, “Draw back the curtains of the bed, for ’tis
    many a day since I woke up in Owlswick. Or is it night indeed? How went
    the fight, then?”</p>

  <p>His eyes stared at the naked rocks and the naked sky beyond them. Then
    with a great groan he lifted himself on his right elbow. Volle put a
    strong arm about him, saying, “Drink the good wine, and have patience.
    There be great doings toward.”</p>

  <p>Spitfire stared round him awhile, then said violently, “Shall we be
    foxes and fugitive men to dwell in holes o’ the hollow mountain side?
    So the bright day is done, ha? Then off with these trammels.” And he
    fell a-tearing at the bandage on his wounds.</p>



  <p>But Volle prevented him with strong hands, saying, “Bethink thee how on
    thee alone, O glorious Spitfire, and on thy wise heart and valiant soul
    that delighteth in furious war, resteth all our hope to ward off from
    our lady wives and dear children and all our good land and fee the fury
    of the men of Witchland, and to save alive the great name of Demonland.
    Let not thy proud heart be capable of despair.”</p>

  <p>But Spitfire groaned and said, “Certain it was that woe and evil hap
    must be to Demonland until my kinsmen be gotten home again. And that
    day I think shall never dawn.” And he cried, “Boasted he not that he is
    king in Demonland? and yet I had not my sword in his umbles. And thou
    thinkest I’ll live in shame?”</p>

  <p>Therewithal he strove again to tear off the bandages, but Volle
    prevented him. And he raved and said, “Who was it forced me from the
    battle? ’Tis pity of his life, to have abused me so. Better dead than
    run from Corinius like a beaten puppy. Let me go, false traitors! I
    will amend this. I will die fighting. Let me go back.”</p>

  <p>Volle said, “Lift up thine eyes, great Spitfire, and behold the lady
    moon, how virgin free she walketh the wide fields of heaven, and the
    glory of the stars of heaven which in their multitudes attend her. And
    as little as earthly mists and storms do dim her, but though she be hid
    awhile yet when the tempest is abated and the sky swept bare of clouds
    there she appeareth again in her steadfast course, mistress of tides
    and seasons and swayer of the fates of mortal men: even such is the
    glory of sea-girt Demonland, and the glory of thine house, O Spitfire.
    And as little as commotions in the heavens should avail to remove these
    everlasting mountains, so little availeth disastrous war, though it be
    a great fight lost as was to-day, to shake down our greatness, that are
    mightiest with the spear from of old and able to make all earth bow to
    our glory.”</p>

  <p>So said Volle. And the Lord Spitfire looked out across the mist-choked
    sleeping valley to the great rock-faces dim in the moonlight and the
    lean peaks grand and silent beneath the moon. He spake not, whether
    for strengthlessness or as charmed to silence by the mighty influences
    of night and the mountain solitudes and by Volle’s voice speaking deep
    and quiet in his ear, like the voice of night herself calming earth-born
    tumults and despairs.</p>



  <p>After a time Volle spake once more: “Thy brethren shall come home
    again: doubt it not. But till then art thou our strength. Therefore
    have patience; heal thy wounds; and raise forces again. But shouldst
    thou in desperate madness destroy thy life, then were we shent indeed.”</p>
